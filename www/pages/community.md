## Join the IPCrypt Community

IPCrypt is an open project that welcomes contributions from the community. Whether you're a developer, researcher, network operator, or privacy advocate, there are many ways to get involved and help improve IPCrypt.

## Ways to Contribute

### Code Contributions

You can contribute to IPCrypt in several ways:

1. **Implement IPCrypt in a New Language**: Create an implementation in a language not currently supported
2. **Improve Existing Implementations**: Enhance performance, add features, or fix bugs in existing implementations
3. **Add Test Cases**: Expand test coverage to ensure implementations are robust and correct
4. **Optimize Algorithms**: Improve the efficiency of cryptographic operations
5. **Create Integration Examples**: Develop examples showing how to integrate IPCrypt with common frameworks and tools

### Documentation Contributions

4. **Submit a Pull Request**: Open a pull request with a clear description of your changes
5. **Respond to Feedback**: Be prepared to address comments and make requested changes

## Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have a suggestion for improvement:

1. **Check Existing Issues**: Make sure the issue hasn't already been reported
2. **Use the Issue Template**: Fill out all relevant sections of the issue template
3. **Be Specific**: Include detailed steps to reproduce bugs
4. **Provide Context**: Explain why a feature would be useful or how a bug affects users

## Communication Channels

### GitHub

The primary platform for collaboration is GitHub:

- [IPCrypt Repository]({{ site.github_repo }}): Main repository for the specification and reference implementations
- [Issues]({{ site.github_repo }}/issues): Report bugs, request features, or ask questions
- [Pull Requests]({{ site.github_repo }}/pulls): Submit changes for review

### IETF

IPCrypt development resources:

- [IETF Datatracker]({{ site.ietf_datatracker }}): Official IETF page for the draft
- [IETF Mailing Lists](https://www.ietf.org/how/lists/): Relevant IETF mailing lists for discussion

## Code of Conduct

All participants in the IPCrypt community are expected to adhere to the [IETF Guidelines for Conduct](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7154) and treat others with respect and professionalism.

## Licensing

All contributions to IPCrypt must be compatible with the project's licensing:

- **Specification**: Contributions to the specification are subject to the IETF Trust Legal Provisions
- **Code Implementations**: Code is typically licensed under the [ISC License]({{ site.github_repo }}/blob/main/LICENSE.md)

By submitting a contribution, you agree to license your work under the same terms as the project.

## Recognition

Contributors to IPCrypt are recognized in several ways:

- **Acknowledgments**: Contributors are listed in the Acknowledgments section of the specification
- **Commit History**: Your contributions are recorded in the Git history
- **Implementation Credits**: If you create or significantly improve an implementation, you'll be credited in that implementation
